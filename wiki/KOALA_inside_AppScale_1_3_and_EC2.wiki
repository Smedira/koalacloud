#This tutorial shows how to install KOALA in an AppScale PaaS that runs inside EC2

[http://koalacloud.appspot.com KOALA] can run inside a Private Cloud PaaS with [http://appscale.cs.ucsb.edu AppScale]. AppScale itself can be run inside EC2, Eucalyptus or just on top of Xen. 

This tutorial shows how to start AppScale 1.3 inside EC2 and upload KOALA into the AppScale PaaS.

At first you neet do install the [http://code.google.com/p/appscale/ appscale-tools].

Pack KOALA sourcecode into a tar.gz

{{{
$ cd koalacloud
$ tar -cvzf koalacloud.tar.gz koalacloud
$ mv koalacloud.tar.gz ../
}}}

Start AppScale PaaS inside EC2 (this need some time. 

{{{
$ appscale-run-instances --file ~/workspace/koalacloud.tar.gz --table voldemort 
--max 2 --machine ami-14799b7d --keyname koalatest -v

... lots of output here ...

Now, the problem is that the web server does not start up. This is a known bug of the AppScale image. The image tries to start the web server too soon before the load balancers configuration (/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/load-balancer.conf) is available. Therefore, you need to log in into the instance and restart the nginx web server manually.

{{{
$ ssh -i ~/.appscale/appscaletest.private ec2-174-129-175-237.compute-1.amazonaws.com -l root
# invoke-rc.d nginx restart
}}}

Check the AppScale instances.

{{{

If you don't want your KOALA Private Cloud PaaS any more, you can kill the instances via

{{{
$ appscale-terminate-instances --keyname appscaletest
