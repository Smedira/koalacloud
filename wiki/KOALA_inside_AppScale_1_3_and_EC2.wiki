#This tutorial shows how to install KOALA in an AppScale PaaS that runs inside EC2

[http://koalacloud.appspot.com KOALA] can run inside a Private Cloud PaaS with [http://appscale.cs.ucsb.edu AppScale]. AppScale itself can be run inside EC2, Eucalyptus or just on top of Xen. 

This tutorial shows how to start AppScale 1.3 inside EC2 and upload KOALA into the AppScale PaaS.

At first you neet do install the [http://code.google.com/p/appscale/ appscale-tools].

Pack KOALA sourcecode into a tar.gz

{{{
$ cd koalacloud
$ tar -cvzf koalacloud.tar.gz . --exclude=tutorial
$ mv koalacloud.tar.gz ../
}}}

Start AppScale PaaS inside EC2 (this need some time. 

{{{
$ appscale-run-instances --file ~/workspace/koalacloud.tar.gz --table voldemort
--max 2 --machine ami-14799b7d --keyname appscaletest -v

... lots of output here ...

Your app can be reached at the following URL: http://ec2-204-236-248-30.compute-1.amazonaws.com/apps/koalacloud
The status of your AppScale instance is at the following URL: http://ec2-204-236-248-30.compute-1.amazonaws.com/status
}}}

Now, the problem is that the web server does not start up. This is a known bug of the AppScale image. The image tries to start the web server too soon before the load balancers configuration (/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/load-balancer.conf) is available. Therefore, you need to log in into the instance and restart the nginx web server manually.

{{{
$ ssh -i ~/.appscale/appscaletest.private ec2-204-236-248-30.compute-1.amazonaws.com -l root
# invoke-rc.d nginx restart
Restarting nginx: nginx.

This is the status page of AppScale. Here you can see the AppScale instances.

When you switch to KOALA now, you need to log first.

[http://koalacloud.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tutorial/images/smaller/tutorial_koala_appscale_2_KOALA_small.png]

When you click *Login* you are redirected to the AppScale login page.

[http://koalacloud.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tutorial/images/smaller/tutorial_koala_appscale_3_login_small.png]

After your successfull login, you can switch back to KOALA.

[http://koalacloud.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tutorial/images/smaller/tutorial_koala_appscale_4_login_successful_small.png]

Now, KOALA ist ready for work. Now, you need to import your credentials.
This is described [http://code.google.com/p/koalacloud/wiki/First_Steps_with_EC2_and_KOALA here].

You can check the AppScale instances also with the command appscale-describe-instances.

To terminate the AppScale instances, you can use the command appscale-terminate-instances.

{{{
