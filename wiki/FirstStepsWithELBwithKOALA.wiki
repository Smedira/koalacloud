= First steps with the KOALA Cloud Manager and ELB =

Before you start with KOALA using [http://aws.amazon.com/elb/ ELB] it is highly appreciated that you consult [http://code.google.com/p/koalacloud/wiki/FirstStepsWithEC2andKOALA this] document that tells what you need to use KOALA at all and how to get your credentials inserted.

For using KOALA to interact with [http://aws.amazon.com/elb/ ELB] you need access to the Amazon Web Services ([http://aws.amazon.com AWS]) because up to now, no Private Cloud solution exists, that is API compatible to the ELB. 

If you have already created an AWS account and inserted your Access Key and Secret Access Key inside the *Regions* window, you can start working with [http://aws.amazon.com/elb/ Amazon ELB] when you switch to one of the four AWS regions with the pull-down menu in the center of the header.
