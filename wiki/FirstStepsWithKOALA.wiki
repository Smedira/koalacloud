#labels KOALA,Introduction,IaaS
= First steps with the KOALA Cloud Manager =

Using KOALA ist quite easy. All you need is

  * a browser
  * a Google account
  * access to one or more cloud infrastructures
  * some basic knowledge about cloud computing

The browser should be no problem. The Google account is used for the user management and authentication. Without access to one or more cloud infrastructures KOALA is worthless and the basic knowledge about cloud computing can be found inside this document.

== Get credentials to a cloud infrastructure ==

You need access to a cloud infrastructure (IaaS) that uses the API of Amazons Elastic Computing Cloud ([http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ EC2]). This is essential because KOALA is a tool/service that helps you working with cloud resources you have  access to. Bu you cannot share cloud resources with others because it is not a cloud marketplace.

See the following table that consists that available cloud infrastructures that are compatible to the EC2 API.

|| *Infrastructure (IaaS)*                 || *Private/Public Cloud* || *License*   ||
|| [http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ Amazon EC2] || Public Cloud           || proprietary ||
|| [http://open.eucalyptus.com Eucalyptus] || Private Cloud          || GPL v3      ||
|| [http://www.nimbusproject.org Nimbus]   || Private Cloud          || Apache License v2.0  ||
|| [http://www.opennebula.org OpenNebula]  || Private Cloud          || Apache License v2.0  ||
|| [http://cloud.com Cloud.com]            || Private Cloud          || GPL v3      ||
|| [http://nimbula.com Nimbula]            || Public Cloud           || proprietary ||

If you don't have any Private Cloud IaaS running. The easiest is to get access to [http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ Amazon EC2]. If you don't want this e.g. because you don't have a credit card and you don't have access to a running Private Cloud you need to run a Private Cloud IaaS yourself.

This tutorial focuses on Amazon EC2 because it is the most common use case.

== Availability Zones ==

The Zones window gives you a table with the names and status of the Availability Zones inside the region you are.

== Keypair ==

To log into your instances, you need a keypair. If you don't already have a keypair inside the region you want to run instances, you need to created at least one. In this example a now keypair new_key_useast is created.
