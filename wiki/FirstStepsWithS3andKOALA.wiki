= First steps with the KOALA Cloud Manager and S3 =

Before you start with KOALA using S3 it is highly appreciated that you consult [http://code.google.com/p/koalacloud/wiki/FirstStepsWithEC2andKOALA this] document that tells what you need to use KOALA at all and how to get your credentials inserted.

For using KOALA to interact with S3 compatible cloud services you need access to at least a single cloud service that uses the API of Amazons Simple Storage Service ([http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ S3]). 

The following table shows the cloud services available that are compatible to the S3 API.

|| *S3 compatible services*                || *Private/Public Cloud* || *License*   || *Supported by KOALA* ||
|| [http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ Amazon S3  ] || Public Cloud           || proprietary || yes ||
|| Walrus from [http://open.eucalyptus.com Eucalyptus] || Private Cloud          || GPL v3      || yes ||
|| Cumulus from [http://www.nimbusproject.org Nimbus]  || Private Cloud          || Apache License v2.0  || yes ||
|| [http://code.google.com/intl/de/apis/storage/ Google Storage]  || Public Cloud          || proprietary  || no ||

[http://code.google.com/intl/de/apis/storage/ Google Storage] support is not yet implemented because this service is currently available to a limited number of U.S. developers only.

If you don't have any S3 compatible Private Cloud services running, the most easy way is to get access to [http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ Amazon S3]. If you don't want this because e.g. you don't have a credit card you need a Private Cloud S3 service.

This tutorial focuses on [http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ Amazon S3] because it is the most common use case for KOALA and the Private Cloud S3 solutions have not the same level of stability and functionality.
